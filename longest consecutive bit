Given a number N. Find the length of the longest consecutive 1s in its binary representation.

Example 1:

Input: N = 14
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Binary representation of 14 is 
1110, in which 111 is the longest 
consecutive set bits of length is 3.
Example 2:

Input: N = 222
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Binary representation of 222 is 
11011110, in which 1111 is the 
longest consecutive set bits of length 4. 
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--)
	{
	    int n;
	    cin>>n;
	    int c=0;
	    while(n!=0)
	    {
	        n=n&(n<<1);
	        c++;
	        
	    }
	    cout<<c<<endl;
	    
	}
	return 0;
}
